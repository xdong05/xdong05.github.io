  image: pub_bsc.png
  description: Using ultra-high resolution data on spatial patterns of biological crust communities and vascular plants at 26 sites across three ecoregion of the US Southwest, we show that species interactions might play a major role in organizing the spatial patterning of dryland vegetation. This leads to the idea of ecosystem spatial self-organization at the community level.

  description: Climate change will change the distribution of ecosystems and the delivery of ecological benefits. In this paper, we evaluated the implications of ecosystem changes for human welfare. Here we estimate country-level changes in economic production and the value of non-market ecosystem benefits resulting from climate-change-induced shifts.

  image: pnas_junna.png
  description: What happens to the community stability under climate change? Using long-term datasets from Sycamore Creek, Arizona, we found tha the mechanisms historically governing community stability become largely weakened as climate changes. Some may even flip to a destabilizing force and drive ecological communities to a state of much lower stability and higher sensitivity to environmental fluctuations.

  image: pub_tiger.png
  description: What explains the regular iron banding in soils? Soil redox conditions, driven by environmental variability, are highly dynamic. We show that two sets of scale-dependent feedbacks are coupled to form redox patterns and environmental variability plays a critical role by dictating the likelihood of pattern formation. The temporal dimension in spatial self-organization has rarely been reported before.

  image: pub_figure1.jpg
  description: Does the type of bedrock an ecosystem is located on affect how sensitive an ecosystem is to climatic variability? This global analysis shows that the answer is yes. Variation in ecosystem sensitivity is significantly affected by regolith porosity and permeability and regolith and soil thickness, through their control on ecosystem water holding capacity.

  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  description: Why does cuprate superconductivity break down at a certain doping level? Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find that an emerging metallic matrix inside the superconducting state is responsible for the overall reduction of Tc and the superfluid density, while leaving the gapsize unchanged. The formation of the matrix is tied to a pair breaking process violating a core principle of mean-field theories.

  description: Are ecosystems with higher biodiversity more stable? We combine data on the distribution of 57,500 plant species and remote-sensing observations in theWestern Hemisphere to investigate the role of multiple facets to diversity (species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and functional diversity) in mediating the ecosystem sensitivity to climatic variability. Regions of greater plant diversity exhibit lower sensitivity to temperature variability.

  description: Air-water gas transfer velocity influences fundamental processes of aquatic systems such as photosynthesis, respiration, and greenhouse gas emission. In this paper, we tested two universal scalings to predict gas transfer velocity, deduced from classic thin-film theory and surface renewal theory. We found that two scalings outperformed all 23 previous models in prediction.

  description: Why the limestone depressions in South Florida are evenly spaced across the landscape? We formalized a new mechanism of pattern formation, i.e., boundary competition among pattern elements of finite amplitude stabilized by scale-dependent feedback in time. Scale-dependent feedback in time stabilizes the individual depressions and induces the boundary competition between depressions for surface water, giving rise to the spatial regularity.

  description: Self-organized regular patterns occur worldwide. Significant effort in the study of self-organized pattern formation has focused on the physical conditions of the ecosystem. But what about the organisms involved? Can just any species form patterns or are certain traits required? This meta analysis at the global scale shows that some species are more likely to form patterns than others, as a result of their possessing a portfolio of traits conducive to pattern formation.
