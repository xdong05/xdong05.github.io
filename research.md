# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand the mechanisms and consequences of landscape spatial pattern formation, especially in the type of landscapes where biological and physical processes strongly interact (e.g., biogeomorphic landscapes). To do so, we use and develop mathematical models, results of which are then compared with data from remote sensing, global databases, or field and experimental measurements.

Here are some themes we currently work on:

**Spatial self-organization of vascular plants - biological crust communities in drylands.** Current theory of ecosystem spatial self-organization considers only one homogenous assemblage of organisms (in the case of drylands, vascular plants). However, species interactions, such as competition and facilitation, can significantly affect ecosystem spatial patterns and their dynamics. To investigate the role of species interactions in ecosystem spatial self-organization, we conceptualize drylands as an integral biocrust - vascular plants complex. We develop new theories and models that are rigorously tested with extensive empirical data collected from the field and from remote sensing imageries, using drylands as our focal system. See [a recent paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-023-00898-2) by Dan for results to date.


**Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.

Beneath permanent ice and meters of liquid water in many Antarctic lakes reside structurally complex arrays of spatially self-organized microbial mats. Changing climate has already begun to transform these unique ecosystems in ways not yet understood. Will benthic communities respond to environmental changes linearly and gradually, or abruptly and catastrophically? If the latter, nonlinear responses might lead to sudden eradication of these unique systems, found nowhere else on Earth, and with it the opportunity to pursue research questions that cannot be addressed elsewhere. Using existing datasets on spatial structure of benthic communities from 37 sites on the floor of Antarctic Lake Vanda, we propose to apply recent theories from Spatial Ecology to investigate the mechanisms that give rise to spatial patterns of pinnacles formed by benthic microbes. We address two questions: (1) What are the morphological and spatial patterns of pinnacles and how do they vary over developmental stages, along environment gradients, and from 2013 to 2023? And (2) what mechanisms give rise to the geometry of individual pinnacles and their spatial distribution? These questions will be addressed by integrating existing datasets, spatial pattern analyses, Bayesian statistical models, and process-based numerical models. These models will allow us to better predict responses of pinnacles to environmental change.

**Josephson STM.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren.Â

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
